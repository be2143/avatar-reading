This helps us stay safe in case there is a real emergency.\nSometimes at home, we may have fire drills too. If the smoke alarm goes off, we calmly leave the house and go to our meeting spot outside. This way, we are prepared and know what to do if there is a fire.\nIn case of a storm or bad weather, it's important to listen to adults and follow their instructions. They will keep us safe by guiding us to a secure place until the danger passes.\nIf we ever get separated from our family in a crowded place, we should look for someone in uniform or a mom with kids to ask for help.
