It's important to remember that saying \"no\" is not being rude or mean. It's standing up for ourselves and our boundaries.\n\nWe can practice saying \"no\" in different situations. For example, if a stranger approaches us and asks for personal information like our name or address, we can firmly say \"no\" and walk away. If someone tries to touch us without our permission, we can say \"no\" and tell a trusted adult about what happened.\n\nIt's also important to know that we can say \"no\" to people we know if they make us feel uncomfortable or unsafe. We have the right to set boundaries with our friends, family members, or teachers. If someone crosses those boundaries, we can say \"no\" and ask for help from a trusted adult.\nRemember, it's okay to say \"no\" when we feel uncomfortable or unsafe. We have the right to protect ourselves and our boundaries. Saying \"no\" is a powerful way to keep ourselves safe. Let's always trust our feelings and speak up when we need to."},

We should never make fun of or dismiss someone's feelings. Instead, we can show empathy and support.\nOne way to respect others' feelings is by using kind words. We can say things like, \"I'm sorry you're feeling sad\" or \"That sounds frustrating.\" These words show that we care about how the other person is feeling.\nAnother way to respect others' feelings is by giving them space when they need it. Sometimes, people want to be alone when they're feeling upset or angry. We can give them privacy and let them know that we're there for them if they need us.\nRespecting others' feelings is an important part of being a good friend and community member. When we take the time to understand and acknowledge how others are feeling, we create a supportive and caring environment. Let's always remember to be kind and considerate towards others' feelings."},
